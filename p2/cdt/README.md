# Eclipse CDT p2 repositories

Online Eclipse CDT p2 repositories, including `FreeBSD aarch64/x86_64` artifacts, built from my [fork](https://github.com/chirontt/eclipse-cdt) of the [Eclipse CDT C/C++ Development Tools](https://github.com/eclipse-cdt/cdt).

This URL is an Eclipse **software repository**; you must use it in Eclipse ([see how](https://help.eclipse.org/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-127.htm)).

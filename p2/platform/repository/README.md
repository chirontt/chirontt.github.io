# Eclipse Platform p2 repositories

Online Eclipse p2 platform repositories, including `FreeBSD aarch64/x86_64` artifacts, built from my [fork](https://github.com/chirontt/eclipse.platform.releng.aggregator) of the [Aggregator repo for Eclipse SDK builds](https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.releng.aggregator).

This URL is an Eclipse **software repository**; you must use it in Eclipse ([see how](https://help.eclipse.org/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-127.htm)).
